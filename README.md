speech to text to text to speech. amazing!

## FAQ

### WHAT

a lot of people don't like sharing their Real Voiceâ„¢ on the internet, which is fair. This project aims to rectify that by
1. Reading their voice and converting it to text (speech to text)
2. Generating an audio file of a robot saying it (to text to speech)
3. Spitting it back out as microphone input.

### HOW

microphone reading library -> Google Speech Recognition -> tts generating library -> virtual microphone

### IS THIS NOT A VOICE CHANGER?

well yes, but actually no.

its a voice change in the sense that its basically taking what you say and then saying it in a different voice but its not a voice changer in the sense that it applies filters to your voice

### HOW DO I USE IT

we dont have a good executable or even a set up guide so it will be up to use on learning how to use it

### DO YOU HAVE A DISCORD

yes! join [here](https://discord.gg/4Ru6SRasJB)!

## INSTALL GUIDE (WIP)

if you have git installed, good just run
```git clone https://github.com/sttttts/sttttts/```
if you dont, you should go get it. it doesnt take long to install


now you need to get the dependencies and their dependencies:
[pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
- [pywin](https://pypi.org/project/pywin/)
[SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
[system_hotkey](https://pypi.org/project/system_hotkey/)
[PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)

or you can run the install.s1 file using powershell **(but if you have python already then use the install.bat)

once everything is done installing, open a command window into the sttttts folder and run
```py main.py``` and you should be good to go!
