# STTTTTS

speech to text to text to speech. amazing!

## what?

a lot of people don't like sharing their Real Voiceâ„¢ on the internet, which is fair. This project aims to rectify that by
1. Reading their voice and converting it to text (speech to text)
2. Generating an audio file of a robot saying it (to text to speech)
3. Spitting it back out as microphone input.

## how?

microphone reading library -> tts generating library -> virtual microphone

## how do i build it?

1. have jdk installed
2. run `./gradlew build` on unix or `.\gradlew build` on windows
3. look in build/libs/

## how do i use it?

ask again when the project is at least mostly complete.
