## FAQ

### what?

a lot of people don't like sharing their Real Voiceâ„¢ on the internet, which is fair. This project aims to rectify that by
1. Reading their voice and converting it to text (speech to text)
2. Generating an audio file of a robot saying it (to text to speech)
3. Spitting it back out as microphone input.

### how?

microphone reading library -> tts generating library -> virtual microphone

### is this not a voice changer?

well yes, but actually no.

its a voice change in the sense that its basically taking what you say and then saying it in a different voice but its not a voice changer in the sense that it applies filters to your voice

### how do i use it?

ask again when we have an executable

### do you have a discord?

yes! join [here](https://discord.gg/4Ru6SRasJB)!

### can i edit this code to port it/add features/etc?

you sure can, but if you publish it you need to credit us. also, if you add a feature to your copy, that doesnt guarantee we will add it to the main thing
